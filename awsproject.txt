1)aws project (report usage of aws resources) using shell scripting with cronjob

steps:

1)ssh into ec2 instance by command

ssh -i <path to .pem file> user@ipaddress

ex:- ssh -i /user/accounts/downloads/devops.pem ec2-user@177.44.44.4

2)create one file with .sh extension

3) vi file.sh

#!/bin/bash

#this script will report the aws resource usage
#AWS S3
#AWS EC2
#AWS Lambda
#AWS IAM Users

set -x

# list s3 buckets 
echo "print list of s3 buckets"
aws s3 ls

#list ec2 instances
echo "print list of ec2 instance"
aws ec2 describe-instances | jq '.Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId'

#list lambda
echo "print list of lambda functions"
aws lambda list-functions

#list IAM users
echo "print list of IAM Users"
aws iam list-users


note:- 
      so, we use aws cli to interact with aws and report the resources of aws services like ec2,s3,lambda,iam users.

we can refer aws cli reference for commands of various services for using aws cli

SET -X


In a shell script, the command "set -x" is used to enable the shell's debugging mode. When this option is enabled, the shell displays each command before executing it, providing a trace of the script's execution. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding how the script is being executed.
